ADS-B tools for Python

The adsb package currently provides tools for working with ADSB messages
produced by software that provides BaseStation-like output, such as
`dump1090 <https://github.com/mutability/dump1090>`_.

This project is very early in development.

Quickstart
==========

adsb is available on PyPI and can be installed with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_.
