Workflow
--------

A bug-fix or enhancement is delivered using a pull request. A good pull request
should cover one bug-fix or enhancement feature. This ensures the change set is
easier to review and less likely to need major re-work or even be rejected.

The workflow that developers typically use to fix a bug or add enhancements
is as follows.

* Fork the ``adsb`` repo into your account.

* Obtain the source by cloning it onto your development machine.

  .. code-block:: console

      $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/adsb.git
      $ cd adsb

* Create a branch for local development:

  .. code-block:: console

      $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

  Now you can make your changes locally.

* Familiarize yourself with the developer convenience rules in the Makefile.

  .. code-block:: console

      $ make help

* Create and activate a Python virtual environment for local development.

  .. code-block:: console

      $ make venv
      $ source path/to/<venv-name>/bin/activate
      (venv) $

  The rule creates the virtual environment outside the project directory so
  that it never accidentally gets added to the change set.

  .. note::

      (venv) is used to indicate when the commands should be run within the
      virtual environment containing the development dependencies.

* Develop fix or enhancement:

  * Make a fix or enhancement (e.g. modify a class, method, function, module,
    etc).

  * Update an existing unit test or create a new unit test module to verify
    the change works as expected.

  * Run the test suite.

    .. code-block:: console

        (venv) $ make test

    See the :ref:`testing-label` section for more information on testing.

  * Check code coverage of the area of code being modified.

    .. code-block:: console

        (venv) $ make check-coverage

    Review the output produced in ``docs/source/coverage/coverage.html``. Add
    additional test steps, where practical, to improve coverage.

  * The change should be style compliant. Perform style check.

    .. code-block:: console

        (venv) $ make check-style

    See the :ref:`style-compliance-label` section for more information.

  * The change should include type annotations where appropriate.
    Perform type annotations check.

    .. code-block:: console

        (venv) $ make check-types

    See the :ref:`annotations-label` section for more information.

  * Fix any errors or regressions.

* The docs and the change log should be updated for anything but trivial bug
  fixes. Perform docs check.

    .. code-block:: console

        (venv) $ make docs

  See the :ref:`documentation-label` section for more information.

* Commit and push changes to your fork.

  .. code-block:: console

      $ git add .
      $ git commit -m "A detailed description of the changes."
      $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

  A pull request should preferably only have one commit upon the current
  master HEAD, (via rebases and squash).

* Submit a pull request through the service website (e.g. Github, Gitlab).

* Check automated continuous integration steps all pass. Fix any problems
  if necessary and update the pull request.
